- Lesson: `notebooks/week1/01_pandas_numpy.ipynb`
- Lab: `notebooks/week1/02_eda_visualization.ipynb`
- Assignment: Clean & explore a dataset; submit a report notebook.

## Week 2 — Statistics & SQL
**Goals:** probability, distributions, hypothesis testing, simple SQL joins & aggregations.
- Lesson: `notebooks/week2/01_statistics_intro.ipynb`
- Lab: `notebooks/week2/02_ab_testing.ipynb`
- Assignment: AB test analysis + writeup.

## Week 3 — Supervised Learning
**Goals:** train/test split, over/underfitting, metrics (RMSE/MAE, Acc/Prec/Rec/F1, ROC-AUC).
